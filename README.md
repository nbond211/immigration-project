Map Validaty:
- Czech republic needs to be combined with slovakia to more accurately reflect that the data is from czechoslovakia
- Danzig removed, as was small and short lived soverign area - probably ok, but should check
- Austria-hungry/austira - is data different? Why? current plan is to have hungary represent austria-hungary data
- Soviet Union - data is currently just linked to russia in map. Need to add Union countries to map to make complete Soviet Union rendering
