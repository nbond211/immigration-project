This project visualizes immigration to the US from Europe in the early 20th century. This project has a specific focus on the quota system instituted by the Immigration Act of 1924
### TODO
Map Validaty:
- Czech republic needs to be combined with slovakia to more accurately reflect that the data is from czechoslovakia
- Macedonia (it's just chilling there on the map with no data to go with it)
- Danzig removed, as was small and short lived soverign area - probably ok, but should check
- Austria-hungry/austira - is data different? Why? current plan is to have hungary represent austria-hungary data
- Soviet Union - data is currently just linked to russia in map. Need to add Union countries to map to make complete Soviet Union rendering
